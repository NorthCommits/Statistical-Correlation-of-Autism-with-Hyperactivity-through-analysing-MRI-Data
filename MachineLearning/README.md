## Overview

This project analyzes child language transcripts from the ASDBank English Nadig Corpus to extract pragmatic and linguistic features, and applies unsupervised clustering to identify ADHD-like language patterns. The workflow includes feature extraction, normalization, clustering, and visualization.

## Dataset

- **Corpus:** ASDBank English Nadig Corpus
- **Creators:** Aparna Nadig, Janet Bang
- **Language:** English
- **Description:** Transcripts of children with ASD and typically developing controls
- **Country:** Canada
- **Date:** 2012-07-01
- **DOI:** [10.21415/T54P4Q](https://doi.org/10.21415/T54P4Q)
- **Types:** cross, toyplay, ASD (see `Nadig/0types.txt`)

The `.cha` files in the `Nadig/` directory are CHAT-format transcripts. Metadata is in `Nadig/0metadata.cdc`.

## Features Extracted
- Fillers (e.g., "uh", "um")
- Repairs (e.g., "I mean", "sorry")
- Repetitions
- Topic shifts
- Interruptions
- Short utterances (<3 words)
- Utterance and word counts
- Mean/median tokens per utterance
- Feature densities (per 100 words/utterances)

## Clustering & Analysis
- Features are standardized using z-scores
- KMeans clustering (k=2) is applied
- An ADHD-like index is computed
- Cluster assignments and silhouette scores are reported
- Elbow and silhouette plots help determine optimal cluster count

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   - Python 3.8+
   - Required packages:
     - pandas
     - numpy
     - scikit-learn
     - matplotlib
     - IPython (for display)

   Install with:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib ipython
   ```

2. **Dataset:**
   - Place the Nadig corpus `.cha` files in the `Nadig/` directory (already included).

## Usage

Run the main script:
```bash
python code.py
```

- The script will extract features, perform clustering, and output CSV files with results.
- Visualizations will be displayed for cluster analysis.

## Outputs
- `features_all.csv`: Extracted features for all files (path hardcoded in script)
- `clustered.csv`: Clustering results (path hardcoded in script)
- Elbow and silhouette analysis plot (displayed)

## Notes
- File paths in `code.py` are currently hardcoded for Windows. Adjust as needed for your environment.
- The script expects the Nadig corpus in the `Nadig/` directory.
